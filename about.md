# About LGSS 

<p class="intro">LGSS is a shared service jointly owned by Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire County Councils and established in October 2010 by the merger of both Corporate Services operations into a single, shared service providing all professional, transactional and operational services to both County Councils. Since then LGSS has secured major new partnerships across the region with many other public service organisations including several District &amp; Borough Councils, NHS Health Bodies, Adults Care Services and schools.</p>

LGSS has a business ethos based on “By the public sector, for the public sector” and operates on an open partnership with a joint risk / reward  business model, whereby all savings are shared between LGSS and the customer so it operates on a ‘not for profit’ basis. This allows LGSS to operate as a genuine trust partner when compared to private sector based partnership alternatives. After nearly four years in operation we now have over 1250 staff providing services to over 300 public sector customers in our region.

LGSS’s growth is focused on the local area within the wider public sector which means we stay close to our customers, which best positions LGSS to help enable better joint and inter-working across the various local public services partnerships; be that Health, Local Government, Education or the Emergency Services. Therefore, by delegating NHFT IM&T Services into LGSS we are then best placed to help NHFT improve cross working with other related Care Services and Health organisations across the County.
